Python cuts out some unnecessary syntax that other languages require, which lends to its relative simplicity. Not only is it simple to write, it is easy to learn.<p>Python’s popularity means there is a rich pool of learning resources and Q&A databases from which you can draw. These resources are especially useful after you download, install, and feel comfortable using, the Python programming environment.<p>This guide will get you there by walking you through the steps to install and setup Python. As well, you will learn basic Python programming to get you on your way.<h3>Needed Materials</h3><ul><li>macOS or Mac OS X<li>15-20 minutes to complete the guide<li>Active internet connection</ul><h3>Installing Python and IDLE</h3><ol class=instruction-set><li><span>Goto <a href=http://www.python.org/downloads target=_blank class=code-link>http://www.python.org/downloads</a>.</span><li><span>Click the yellow button that says 'Download Python 3.5.2.'</span> <img src=images/mac-install/1.png alt=""><li id=step-3a><span>Run the downloaded file once downloaded.</span><li><span>Click 'Continue' on the bottom right of installation window.</span> <img src=images/mac-install/2.png alt=""><li><span>Continue clicking 'Continue' on the bottom right until it says 'Agree.'</span><li><span>Click 'Agree' to continue the installation.</span> <img src=images/mac-install/3.png alt=""><li><span>Click 'Install' on the bottom right of installation window.</span> <img src=images/mac-install/4.png alt=""><li><span>Enter password if prompted.</span> <img src=images/mac-install/5.png alt=""><p>The installation will begin and make take a few minutes.

Using this program we will teach you the most basic principles of coding. Although there are many programming languages, Python is one of the more popular languages.<p>Below are guides to help you through your first two programming experiences using IDLE. To start, we need to learn how to use IDLE, how to <i>create</i> and <i>run</i> code.<h3>"Hello, World!" - Your First Program</h3><p>"Hello, World!" is a simple computer program that beginners write to learn how to use programming tools like IDLE. You should already have IDLE open and launched from the installation if not then refer back to <a href=#step-9a>Step 9</a> from above.<p>The goal of this program is to <i>create</i> and <i>run</i> code that says “Hello, World!” Literally. After you should be familiar with the following concepts in IDLE.<ul><li>Creating a new file<li>Creating a new program<li>Saving your code<li>Running your code<li>Viewing the result of your program in the console window</ul><ol class=instruction-set><li><span>Open a new file in IDLE.</span><p>To open a new file you go to <code>File > New File</code>.</p><img src=images/mac-instructions/1.png><li id=step-2b><span>Copy and paste the code below into the new file.</span> <code><pre>print('Hello, World!')</pre></code><p>The code above types/prints "Hello, World!" to IDLE window. It uses a function called <code>print</code> to do so. Each programming language is different, so this only works in Python.<li id=step-3b><span>Save and run the code.</span><p>After the code is in the new file, go to <code>Run > Run Module</code>.</p><img src=images/mac-instructions/2.png><p>The new file window then asks where you want to save your code. Go ahead and name it "Hello World" and save it on your desktop.</p><img src=images/mac-instructions/3.png><li><span>Check that <code>Hello, World!</code> was printed in the IDLE window.</span> <img src=images/mac-instructions/4.png><p>At this point you should see something similar above. If not, make sure the code provided in <a href=#step-2b>Step 2</a> matches the code in your new file.<p>If not, change it to match and go back to <a href=#step-3b>Step 3</a>.<li><span>Change your code to the example provided below and rerun your code.</span> <code><pre>print('Hi, World!')</pre></code><p>Changing and re-running the code shows how you can modify your code and run it at anytime.<p>Now go to <code>Run > Run Module</code> again and look at the new output! The IDLE window now shows <code>Hi, World!</code> below <code>Hello, World!</code>. The most recent output is always shown at the bottom.</p><img src=images/mac-instructions/5.png></ol><p>Congratulations! You now know how to make a new file, write your own code, save it, and run it! We’ll now go to the next excerise.</div></div><footer class="demo-footer mdl-mini-footer"><div class=mdl-mini-footer--left-section><ul class=mdl-mini-footer--link-list><li><a href=#>Help</a><li><a href=#>Privacy and Terms</a><li><a href=#>User Agreement</a></ul></div></footer></main></div><script src=https://code.getmdl.io/1.2.1/material.min.js></script><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script>
