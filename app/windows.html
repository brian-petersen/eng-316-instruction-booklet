            <h3 id="programming-with-python">Programming with Python</h3>
            <p>
              The Python programming language is gaining popularity as a fundamental tool for scientific computing. Python cuts out some unnecessary syntax that other languages require, which lends to its relative simplicity. Not only is it simple to write, it is easy to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
              Python's popularity means there is a rich pool of learning resources and Q&A databases from which you can draw. These resources are especially useful after you download, install, and feel comfortable using, the Python programming environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              This guide will get you there by walking you through the steps to install and setup Python. You also will learn basic Python programming.

            <p>Congratuations, you have successfully installed Python and launched IDLE!</p>

            <h3 id="programming">Programming in Python with IDLE</h3>
            <p>
              In the previous section you installed and launched IDLE. We now will teach you basic principles of coding using IDLE.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below are sections to help you through your first two programming experiences using IDLE. To start, we need to learn how to use IDLE and how to <b>create</b> and <b>run</b> code.
            </p>

            <h3 id="hello-world">"Hello, World!" - Your First Program</h3>
            <p>
              "Hello, World!" is a simple computer program that beginners write to learn how to use programming tools like IDLE. You should already have IDLE open and launched from the installation. If not then refer back to <a href="#step-7a">Step 7</a> from the previous section.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this program is to <b>create</b> and <b>run</b> code that says "Hello, World!" After you should be familiar with the following concepts in IDLE.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating a new file</li>
              <li>Saving your code</li>
              <li>Running your code</li>
              <li>Viewing the result of your program in the IDLE window</li>
            </ul>

            <ol class="instruction-set">
              <li>
                <span>Open a new file in IDLE.</span>
                <p>To open a new file you go to <code>File > New File</code>.</p>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/1.png">
              </li>
              <li id="step-2b">
                <span>Copy and paste the code below into the new file.</span>
                <pre><code>print('Hello, World!')</code></pre>
                <p>
                  The code above types/prints "Hello, World!" to IDLE window. It uses a function called <code>print</code> to do so. Each programming language is different, so this only works in Python.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li id="step-3b">
                <span>Save and run the code.</sfpan>
                <p>After the code is in the new file, go to <code>Run > Run Module</code>.</p>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/2.png">
                <p>The new file window then asks where you want to save your code. Go ahead and name it "Hello World" and save it on your desktop.</p>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/3.png">
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Check that <code>Hello, World!</code> was printed in the IDLE window.</span>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/4.png">
                <p>At this point you should see something similar above. If not, make sure the code provided in <a href="#step-2b">Step 2</a> matches the code in your new file.</p>
                <p>If not, change it to match and go back to <a href="#step-3b">Step 3</a>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Change your code to the example provided below and re-run your code.</span>
                <pre><code>print('Hi, World!')</code></pre>

                <p>
                  Changing and re-running the code shows how you can modify your code and run it at anytime.

                  <!-- TODO is this really needed? -->
                  <!-- Reselect your file window where you pasted your <code>print</code> function and change <code>Hello, World</code> to <code>Hi, World!</code> -->
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now go to <code>Run > Run Module</code> again and look at the new output! The IDLE window now shows <code>Hi, World!</code> below <code>Hello, World!</code>. The most recent output is always shown at the bottom.
                </p>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/5.png">
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Congratulations! You now know how to make a new file, write your own code, save it, and run it! We’ll now go to the next exercise.
            </p>

            <h3 id="if-statements">Using <code>if</code> Statements</h3>
            <p>
              In this section we will show you how to create a program that compares two numbers and tells you which of the two numbers is greater (for example, is 3 > 4?). <code>if</code> statements will be used to have the program compare the two numbers for us and then determines which is largest.
            </p>
            <p>
              This program also introduces new programming functions. After making this program you should be familiar with the following concepts.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables</li>
              <li>Accepting input from the user</li>
              <li><code>if</code> statements</li>
              <li>Formatting a <code>print</code> statement</li>
            </ul>

            <ol class="instruction-set">
              <li>
                <span>Open a new file in IDLE.</span>
                <p>To open a new file from IDLE go to <code>File > New File</code>.</p>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/1.png">
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Copy and paste the code below into the new file.</span>
                <pre><code>variable1 = 4
variable2 = 6</code></pre>
                <p>
                  The code above creates two variables named <code>variable1</code> and <code>variable2</code>. Their values are <code>4</code> and <code>6</code>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Replace 4 and 6 with <code>input</code> functions.</span>
                <p>
                  We will modify the variables we created to allow the users to type in their own numbers when we run the program. To do this we will use the <code>input</code> function.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​<code>input​</code> is a function that prints out what is in the parentheses and then waits for the user to type in a value. We want this value to become the value of the variables we have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To replace <code>4</code> and <code>6</code> with <code>input</code> functions, copy and paste this code.
                </p>
                <pre><code>variable1 = input('Type in the first number and press Enter: ')
variable2 = input('Type in the second number and press Enter: ')</code></pre>
                <p>
                  Whatever is typed by the user is then stored into the variable named <code>variable1</code>. This is similar to a variable in mathematics. The same happens for <code>variable2</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Feel free to run this program and see how the shell window waits for the user to type in the first number before it moves on to the next number.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Add <code>if</code> statements to compare the variables by copying and pasting the following code.</span>
                <p>
                  The code below is how your code should look after adding the <code>if</code> statements. Copy and paste this code into the new file.
                </p>
                <pre><code>variable1 = input('Type in the first number and press Enter: ')
variable2 = input('Type in the second number and press Enter: ')

if variable1 > variable2:
if variable2 > variable1:</code></pre>
                <p>
                  Above we use the <code>></code> symbol to ask if the variable on the left side is greater than the one to the right. What's important now is that you tell the user if it is by using a <code>print</code> function!
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Add <code>print</code> functions to inform the user which variable is larger by copying and pasting the following code.</span>
                <p>
                  The code below is how your code should look after adding the <code>print</code> statements. Copy and paste this code into the new file.
                </p>
                <pre><code>variable1 = input('Type in the first number and press Enter: ')
variable2 = input('Type in the second number and press Enter: ')

if variable1 > variable2:
    print(variable1 + " is greater than " + variable2 + ".")
if variable2 > variable1:
    print(variable2 + " is greater than " + variable1 + ".")</code></pre>
                <p>
                  Above we added code after the colons. The code after the colons runs only if the statement expressed is <i>true</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You also can see that we use <code>variable1</code> and <code>variable2</code> in the <code>print</code> functions. This prints the value that the user typed in. The ​<code>+</code>​ symbol makes the variables and typed words into one statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if the user types in <code>1</code> and <code>3</code>, the first <code>if</code> statement is false so it does not print the statement. The second is true and so it prints "3 is greater than 1."
                </p>
              </li>
              <!-- <li>
                <span>Review the code.</span>
                <p>
                  Below is an example of what your code should look like when you finish.
                </p>
                <pre><code>variable1 = input('Type in the first number and press Enter: ')
variable2 = input('Type in the second number and press Enter: ')

if variable1 > variable2:
    print(variable1 + " is greater than " + variable2 + ".")
if variable2 > variable1:
    print(variable2 + " is greater than " + variable1 + ".")</code></pre>
                <p>
                  Feel free to copy and paste the code if you need.
                </p>
              </li> -->
              <li>
                <span>Run and test the code.</span>
                <p>
                  You can run it by going to <code>Run > Run Module</code>. If you are asked to save your code, name it "If Statements"</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can now test your code! You should see results similar to the example below.
                </p>
                <img src="images/windows-instructions/6b.png">
              </li>
              <p>
                Re-run your code and try different values to make sure it runs correctly!
              </p>
            </ol>
